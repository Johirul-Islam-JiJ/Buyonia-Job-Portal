To add a route to the job show page, you need to define a route in the `web.php` file in your Laravel project. Assuming that you have a `JobController` with a method named `show` that displays the details of a single job, you can define a route like this:

```
Route::get('/jobs/{id}', 'JobController@show')->name('job.show');
```

This code defines a route that listens for GET requests with a URL like `/jobs/123`, where `123` is the ID of the job you want to display. It calls the `show` method on the `JobController`, passing the ID as a parameter. It also gives the route a name of `job.show`, which you can use later to generate URLs.

To add the link to the card, you can wrap the card in an anchor tag (`<a>`) and set the `href` attribute to the URL of the job show page. Assuming that you have the ID of the job available in the `$job->id` variable, you can do it like this:

```
<a href="{{ route('job.show', ['id' => $job->id]) }}">
    <div class="card">
        <!-- card content here -->
    </div>
</a>
```

This code generates a URL to the job show page using the `route` helper function and the name of the route (`job.show`). It passes an array of parameters to the function, which includes the ID of the job in the `id` parameter. It then uses the URL as the `href` attribute of the anchor tag that wraps the card.

So, the complete code for the card with the link to the job show page would look like this:

```
<a href="{{ route('job.show', ['id' => $job->id]) }}">
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-between">
                <h5 class="card-title">{{ $job->title }}</h5>
                <p>Posted 11 Hours Ago</p>
            </div>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-start">
                <span class="card-text" style="margin-right:40px;">
                    <i class="fa-brands fa-staylinked"></i>
                    {{ $job->company_name }}
                </span>
                <span class="card-text">
                    <i class="fa-solid fa-location-dot"></i>
                    {{ $job->location }}
                </span>
            </div>
            <div>
                <span>
                    <i class="fa-solid fa-money-check-dollar" style="margin-right:10px;"></i>
                    <i class="fa-solid fa-bangladeshi-taka-sign"></i>
                    {{ $job->salary }}
                </span>
            </div>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-start">
                <span class="job-category">{{ $job->type }}</span>
                <span class="job-nature">{{ $job->job_nature }}</span>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</a>
```
